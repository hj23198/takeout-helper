# A tool for downloading shared files from Google Takeout 

Have you ever been in that all too common situation where your school Google account is about to be deleted?
The easy solution is to use Google takeout, which sends you a copy of all of your accounts data. However, this method comes with a drawback. 

For files that are shared with your Google account, they are not actually downloaded. Instead, you are provided a url to the document. 
The obvious issue with this is since you no longer have access to your account, you also no longer have access to the shared document.

While it is possible to manually download all of them, with tools such as Google Classroom you can have hundreds or even thousands of shared files associated with your school Google account.

This script automatically downloads shared files missing from a Google Takeout. 

## Important

This script ONLY downloads documents, spreadsheets, and presentations

Inevitably, some files will either fail to download, or will not fall in these three categories. Please check "output.log" 
for a list of these files after usage. The log file will provide urls to the missing files, but these will need to be downloaded manually.

## Requirements
- Python3
- Firefox
- geckodriver

## Quickstart (for those who have an idea of what they are doing)
- Clone repository
- Ensure you have Firefox and geckodriver installed (or replace the driver in line 54 of main.py)
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Replace SRCPATH in secret.py with the path to "Takeout/Drive" of your Google Archive
- Replace DESTPATH in secret.py with desired backup path (backup is created and modified instead of original, this should not be an existing folder)
- Run main.py 
## Adding files to an existing backup
With a large amount of files to backup, it is good practice to do so some time beforehand. However, the associated Google account may be still in use during these remaining weeks. The combine.py script helps take care of this problem. 

- Use Google Takeout once more
- Point TO_ADD in secret.py to the new /Drive directory
- Ensure that DESTPATH in secret.py is accurate (If you moved the resulting directory you will need to update this)
- Run combine.py
- Run main.py

## Slowstart (for those who have no idea of what they are doing)
### Dependencies
- Open a terminal.
- Type "git --version" and press enter
- If you see a version, you're good to go. Otherwise, install git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Type "python --version" and press enter. If you do not see a version, try "python3 --version". If neither of these work, install python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- If you do not have Firefox, install it (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- If you do not have geckodriver, install it (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

### Download 
- Create a folder for the download
- Go back to the terminal and type "cd " followed by the file path to the folder you just created, then press enter. If at any point you close the terminal, this will need to be done again before you continue
- Click on the green "<> Code" button in this github repository. Copy the link to your clipboard
- Go back to the terminal and type "git clone " then paste the link into the terminal. Hit enter. All of this projectâ€™s files will be copied to the folder. 

### Setting up environment 
- Type "python -m venv .venv" and press enter. Then, type "source .venv/bin/activate". You may need to use "python3" instead of "python"
- Type "pip install -r requirments.txt". This installs the libraries for the script

### Configuration 
- Type "open ." This should open an instance of finder in the project folder.
- Locate "secret.py" and open it in any text editor 
- Replace the file path to the right of "SRCPATH" with that of the "Drive" folder in your Google Takeout, and "DESTPATH" with an empty folder that you want the data copied to. If anything goes wrong, the original Google Takeout folder is completely unmodified 
- Example: 

SRCPATH = "/Users/username/Desktop/Takeout/Drive"

DESTPATH = "/Users/username/Desktop/Copy of Drive"

### Running 
- Type "python main.py". "python" might need to be replaced with "python3". This will start the script. If for some reason you want to stop the script, you can press control + c while in the terminal
- At this point a Firefox window should automatically open with a window to more instructions (How fun!). However, those instructions are also detained below

### Operation
- Do not close the automatically opened tab or rearrange tabs. This could cause an issue later.
- Open a new tab and sign in to Google. This allows files shared with you to be accessed. Make sure that you are signing into the Google account associated with the Google Takeout
- Go back to the terminal and press enter. This signals to the script that you are signed in.
-The browser will then navigate to a settings page. Change the default download folder to the "Download" folder included in the archive copy you made
-Now, go back to the terminal and press enter again. This will start the download process

- If something happens and the script crashes, restart it with "python main.py". It will automatically resume its place, but you will need to sign in to Google again
